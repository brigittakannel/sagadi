More than 250 hectares of land in the Koorküla forest district in Valga County was sprayed with DDT oil emulsion solution to control cockchafers. The results were regarded as fully positive, even though, in addition to the intended species, many of the things that had in no way been intended to be destroyed were also destroyed.</p>

            <p>In January, in anticipation of the upcoming monetary reform, the Supreme Council of the ESSR allocated $150 million worth of forest lands to the Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank), which were intended to be used as collateral for foreign currency loans. Immediately before the monetary reform, Bank of Estonia recovered national deposits left in foreign banks before World War II, and there was no longer the need to use forest as collateral. Yet, Estonians still have the conviction that the forest was used as the asset representing the Estonian kroon.</p>

On the other hand, also important are activities that do not generate direct economic returns but are beneficial for everyone: forest conservation, eco-friendly forestry, creating free recreational facilities, providing nature education, etc.</p>
